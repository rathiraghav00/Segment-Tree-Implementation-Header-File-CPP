# Segment-Tree-Implementation-Header-File

A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. This includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements A[l...r], or finding the minimum element in a such a range in O(log N) time. Between answering such queries the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even change the elements of a whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements  A[l...r] to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment)

In general a Segment Tree is a very flexible data structure, and a huge number of problems can be solved with it. Segment Tree is a basically a binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments. Each node in the Segment Tree represents an interval.
