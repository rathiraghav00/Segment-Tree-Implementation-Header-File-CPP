# Segment Tree

Segment Tree is a basically a binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments. Each node in the Segment Tree represents an interval. 

A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. This includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements arr[l...r] in O(log N) time. Between answering such queries the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even change the elements of a whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements arr[l..r] to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment) in logarithmic time complexity
